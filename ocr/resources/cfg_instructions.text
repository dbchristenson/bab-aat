Modify your .cfg file with a text editor.
Make sure that batch=64.
Note the subdivisions. Depending on the network dimensions and the amount of memory available on your GPU, you may need to increase the subdivisions. The best value to use is 1 so start with that. See the Darknet/YOLO FAQ if 1 doesn't work for you.
Note max_batches=.... A good value to use when starting out is 2000 x the number of classes. For this example, we have 4 animals, so 4 * 2000 = 8000. Meaning we'll use max_batches=8000.
Note steps=.... This should be set to 80% and 90% of max_batches. For this example we'd use steps=6400,7200 since max_batches was set to 8000.
Note width=... and height=.... These are the network dimensions. The Darknet/YOLO FAQ explains how to calculate the best size to use.
Search for all instances of the line classes=... and modify it with the number of classes in your .names file. For this example, we'd use classes=4.
Search for all instances of the line filters=... in the [convolutional] section prior to each [yolo] section. The value to use is (number_of_classes + 5) * 3. Meaning for this example, (4 + 5) * 3 = 27. So we'd use filters=27 on the appropriate lines.
