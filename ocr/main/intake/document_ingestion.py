def save_document(file: File, vessel: Vessel) -> int | None:
    """
    Saves or updates a Document record in the database using an uploaded file
    and an associated Vessel. Checks for an existing document with the same
    vessel, file name, or derived document number. Compares metadata (file
    size and last modified timestamp). If an existing document is found and
    its metadata differs, the document is deleted and a new one is created.
    Otherwise, the document is not re-saved.

    Args:
        file (File): The uploaded file object.
        vessel (Vessel): The Vessel instance associated with the document.

    Returns:
        A list of integers representing the IDs of the saved or updated
        Document records.

        None if the document already exists with identical metadata.

    Raises:
        IntegrityError: If database constraints are violated during saving.
        OSError: If file metadata cannot be read.

    Notes:
        - The document_number is derived from the file name.
        - As the uploaded file might not have an inherent last-modified time,
          the current timestamp is used.
        - This function relies on Djangoâ€™s FileField storage to handle moving
          the file from a temporary to a permanent location.
